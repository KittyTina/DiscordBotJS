# DiscordBotJS EXAMPLE Project

## An interesting and practical multi-feature bot

This project is an example of what can be created when two gta players that enjoy intriguing, fun, and practical things get together ğŸ˜ƒ
Current parts of the project include features below

## Inspiring Messages

Adding Inspire feature: when someone writes the message "$inspire" into the chat, the bot will return a random inspirational quote from an API
The quotes are from zenquotes.io, but you can use any other API that returns any sort of string that motivates you ğŸ™‚

## Alphavantage

Adding Alphavantage support so you can use a simple command to display the current stock market

- to make sure that alphavantage works
  => replace the "key"-field in config.json with your actual api-key
- to make sure that the bot works
  => replace the "token goes here"- field in config.json with your actual bot token
  => use your own bot token - not mine if I (Tina) was dumb enough to paste it in there again + push it ğŸ˜‘
- enjoy your bot ğŸ˜Š

We will add more features in the future!
Till then,
Kind regards from Tina and Savic ğŸ˜˜
