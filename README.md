# Alphavantage
Adding Alphavantage support so you can use a simple command to display the current stock market

  - to make sure that alphavantage works
    => replace the "key"-field in config.json with your actual api-key
  - to make sure that the bot works
    => replace the "token goes here"- fiield in config.json with your actual bot token
    => use your own bot token - not mine if I was dumb enough to paste it in there again + push it ğŸ˜‘
  - enjoy your bot ğŸ˜Š
  
 We will add some features in the future! 
 Till then,
 Kind regards from Tina and Savic ğŸ˜˜
